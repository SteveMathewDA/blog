        <p>I like to ponder over things that sometimes nearly seem impossible. I like writing whatever comes up to my mind. I find a way to project my insights; music has been a great way to do it. I am a musician since childhood and an arranger. I love computers and an avid user and learner when it comes to modern technology. I feel that a unique approach to any problem is vital to make an impact at some level. I like to think about a lot of problems (research problems) in terms of basic mathematics and quantitative logic. I love the language of English. I have been fascinated by the complex sciences and loved 'em when I could interpret them on multidisciplinary fronts. I do have a thirst to learn and wish to become a Computational Astrophysicist someday and continue to be a musician.
