        <p><p>The Depth of Art</p></p>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
        <p>Certain things in this world distinguish human from any other creature. One of them is the ability to reason, to contemplate and to comprehend. Yes, they are all under the same ability. Even if anyone quality lacks, it makes us animal. There is a deep thrive to know what's going around for every creature in this world. But man can analyze the deep environmental and scientific implications on any observed event.</p> 
        <p>Man has been able to appreciate various art forms throughout the various walks of life. It enables one to portray their views on a particular subject. Man has been able to communicate effectively using various forms of art. The greatest answers to the most difficult questions are often simple. Yet, sometimes, some things cannot be quantified and they cannot be efficiently analyzed with the help of modern techniques. But that doesn't mean that they are not perceivable. It has to be accepted that they cannot be dealt with the same way other shallow quantifiable sciences are perceived. And nevertheless, it never belittles the art, rather the fact that its rules and norms cannot be deciphered easily takes the complexity of art to a whole different level. </p>
        <p>It is a bitter fact that the arts and basic sciences are often looked down in today's world of technology and advancements. The illusion of the technology being the stronghold, often makes us vulnerable to demean traditional arts and we end up simply cheating ourselves when we try grading a particular art based on its consequences and not by its causes. It is worthwhile to mention that the various psychological effects that the Art imply on humans are proven very clearly using 'modern techniques'. </p>
        <p>It is to be perceived through common sense that something very old is supposed to be a fruit of nature. The fundamentally good stuff like air or water can never be replaced. It is to be noticed that it is indirectly implied that the consequences of nature, irrespective of their merits, are inevitable. In the same way, the Man has always been able to appreciate many art forms since age-old civilizations. Under this condition, it can be implied that the man can be natural only when cohabitating with the gifts nature has provided us. Art is a gift that is ingrained in every man. It is absurd to state that one has no affinity towards Art. This statement does not only try to break a natural phenomenon but also makes one question their attributes as a human. </p>
        <p>By saying 'Art', it is to be noted that every attribute of nature can be viewed, perceived and analyzed artistically. It is not the subset of fine-arts that are alone good enough to be termed 'Art'. To put this in the briefest way possible, it is that every sphere of engineering, science and technology are, in one way or the other, subsets of the great Art. The same instinct in us that makes us crave for assurance in every way. It is the very same instinct that has baffled men till this moment and will continue to till the very end of time. </p>
        <p>Man has tried to quantify everything that is around him using scientific principles and has often forgotten that there is something that gives him the talent to perceive to whichever extent of discovery he has able to achieve. And that, in every possible way, states that there is a bigger factor of nature present among us that reveals us the greatest truths of science and nature, not to make us boast of our own scientific achievements and technological advancements but rather to appreciate the intricate creations of the Almighty and to be grateful for every good that one has received. And that is the Art of Humanity. And that what makes us truly human. The point is that 'One who values the evergreen arts, values its creator and doing so, is the greatest Art, the Art of Being Human.</p>
        <p>There are many arts that exist in nature and that reveals the true self in a man. It is humane to value them and to preserve them and to accept the fact that the byproducts of nature are supposed to carry the maximum depth in them than any manmade science or technology. It is also to important to accredit fine arts based on their duration of existence and the influence it has on one of its own peers, a natural creation, The Man.

        <p><p>Who are you?</p></p>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
        <p>Goodness! The greatest questions in life are often not asked; yet their answers are simple. Man is a wonderful being. It's a blessing to be born a human. But are we truly worthy of it? What does it mean to be worthy of life? Let's break it down. What does it mean to be worthy of something? Why should we be even trying to do justice for every good or bad thing that comes in the way of our life?</p>

        <p>What if I had said your life costed many lives? You'll lose your mind if you try going deep into that subject! But to substantiate my point which I feel everyone should know and as I feel it's a responsibility of everyone born to know the value of their life.</p>
            
            
            
        <p>The Complex Beauty of one being born!</p>
            
        <p>We all love our birthdays! It can be a bit embarrassing at times too! But a pleasant day when people tend to act like they remember you're alive! But rather they came to know that it's your birthday only after Facebook sent a notification saying it's your birthday today! We feel in either of 2 ways on our birthdays. We either feel blessed or we regret for having wasted one more year. But we all have that comforting way of approach towards the day by thanking God for everything that he has blessed us with and for the fact that he has sustained yet another year of our life. We thank saying, "Thank you Lord for adding another year in my Life!"</p>
            
        <p>I had discussed about the feeling of regret. Regretting that we haven't been truly effectively as we could've been in the past year. But what is the true remedy to make sure that we spend our remaining life in a more satisfactory way?</p>
            
        <p>The human mind understands things better when we talk in terms of numbers. Irrespective of knowing the number of zeros, we tend to get attracted when a fact is proposed based on numbers. We all know how we were born. Biologically speaking, a human life starts in the form of a zygote. A zygote is the fused cell made up of a sperm and an egg. A zygote is formed by the fertilization of a sperm and an egg. But it isn't that simple though. Before the fertilization, there is a competition between 350 million sperms. The first sperm that reaches the egg fertilizes with it. The beauty is that each of the sperms give way for an individual. To be more clear, just because the sperm that was responsible for your birth reached the egg first, you are here, wherever you are. Imagine, it's 350 million. Logically, not any other sperm could have given way for your birth except that is responsible for your existence at the moment. So for an individual to be born, around 350 million other individuals were left behind. Try to imagine: Even your parents were born the same way. Everyone who bore your ancestors are that one among 350 million each. If every person who was responsible for your existence dumped behind 350 million people, know that you are special. And everyone you come across in the journey of your life was born the same way.</p>
            
        <p>Let's talk about another mind-blowing permutation. Now that we know that your parents could have bore any 1 out of 350 million and at the end, you are here. If there is such a myriad of birth-giving possibilities when only just a couple are considered, it's obvious that you cannot be born to any other couple. YOU CANNOT BE BORN TO ANYONE EXCEPT TO YOUR PARENTS. Now let's dig deeper. What is the possibility that your father and mother should have met?! If they were married to different people, there was not even a remote possibility that you could've been born. Breaking things down, your parents could've been married to anyone.</p>

        <p>Let's do the math! Consider a gross assumption that there are equal men and women in this world. The total global population is 7.5 billion. The percentage of adults in the world is approximately, 62.8%, which turns out to be 4.71 billion. Now, putting in what we considered, we land approximately at 2.355 billion of adult men and adult women each.</p>
            
        <p>Now let's get back to the point, both your parents had approximately 2.355 billion people to get married to. Each of those combinations would have paved way to anyone of the 350 million children for each of them. So you're just one among 1.6485*(10^18) chances!</p>
            
        <p>What do you actually call all this? Call it a coincidence? I feel it's a tremendous sin to call it's a coincidence. We know how much stringent punishment is given for attempt of a murder in each of our countries. But imagine, how many people's right to be born is stolen for one person to accomplish his/her birth. It's hard to make justice for this subject. But we can all do one thing. We can put our heart and soul to be faithful and worthy of the amazing gift of life that has been bestowed upon us. The almighty chose us to be born. It's no coincidence. It's the perfect plan of nature. We can never give a substantiating justification that proves that we are fit to be born. We can never compensate to all the goodness that 1.6485*(10^18) people could have brought to the world. But all that we could do is to strive to the best of our abilities to make this world a better place for everyone to live in.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Never underestimate others</p>
            
            
            
                <p>We often end up in petty disputes and complaint for everything bad that happens to us from the outside world. We argue, fight, make things worse by our useless conversations. But would we have done that to others if we had realised they too are fruits of God's divine plan and accept the fact they are chosen too?</p>
            
            
            
                    <p> We are still more blessed</p>
            
                        <p>Human minds are terribly awesome at making comparisons. Many times we find people superior to us and feel so low and depressed. But every moment when we realise that we are chosen to be born, it shouldn't be a moment of pride in our hearts but rather complete and utmost submission, realising that we are no way qualified for life even before we were born. The point I wanted to put here is that we are definitely blessed since we have the opportunity to be born, but even more blessed when compared to many people who are born. Imagine the kids born in the daunting, filthy villages of interior countries in Africa or the kids found loitering in the slums of India. God has destined in which family, when and where we are supposed to be born! In what way is it just to claim that it's acceptable to be born in an undesirable condition? No kid suffering in Syria is ought to be born there while there are kids born in the royal families in European Nations.</p>
            
                            <p> But all we can do is not question how the the gift of life is gifted or how the place of a person's birth is pre-destined. But just understand that we are too small to understand how things fall into place. The world's a beautiful place and everyone's here for a purpose. It's not a coincidence that we are born in this world, pushing millions and billions aback. Somewhere in the unknown multiverse, it is destined that we have to be born and because it was felt that we would be the best choice among all the other people. And we ought to be worthy of it.</p>
            
            
            
                                <p>The True Question</p>
            
                                    <p>Man has always tried to find the source of his existence. But has failed for millenniums. The most-widely accepted theory behind the creation of the Universe is the Big-Bang Theory. The prime idea behind this hypothesis is the idea of coincidence. Let's forget all the other contradictory controversies that are against this theory. But let's talk a bit more science. The Big Bang Theory says the big bang was irregular and less-orderly. If the facts regarding the Big Bang theory are true, there's yet an another logical mistake. It is said that it isn't orderly. When the bang had taken place, it would have been a tremendous outbreak of particles and charges. On what earth would a person with a normal mind accept that the charges and particles are balanced when such a big explosion that has taken place? The explosion is so big that it apparently contained all the celestial bodies that are present in the universe right now. How is it even possible that not even one proton or an electron is extra/less after such a hardcore outbreak of particles has taken place? And if it was so, the Universe wouldn't exist because the energy needs to be neutral in a system. That parameter needs to be true in a laboratory only to perform a test. If even a small test requires so much care and orderliness, the universe definitely needs the same condition in even a greater degree. If we come to a conclusion that the total energy is not neutral/balanced, we also say that the Law of Conservation of Energy is false. If we tend to do that, we are indirectly disproving almost all the theories of modern physics and the law is the base for almost all the theories of Modern Physics. And the only defense to this proposal is saying that the entire charge and energy is conserved. Once we come to this conclusion, we are obviously disproving the theory because it states that the entire process was irregular.</p>
            
                                        <p>Let's make it simpler for people who try proving the Big Bang Theory right. Let's say the energy was uniformly distributed when the entire bang took place (which practically makes no sense). If that is the case, then every celestial body/ a system of celestial bodies would look and be composed same way as every other celestial body/ system of bodies. But it's not true! There's only one Earth that looks exactly like the Earth!</p>
            
                                            <p>So man has tried to trace the path back how he was created for decades and centuries. But has never been able to give a proper, convincing explanation. There are several groups of people who accept certain theories. It's upto each individual how they handle this situation.</p>
            
                                                <p>But what is a convincing explanation? Many scientists have been perplexed by this subject and most of them have come to a conclusion saying, 'It is hard for man to give any proper explanation in this topic and man's way of thinking is restricted logically and time-based.</p>
            
                                                    <p>With all due humbleness, the most mature conclusion is saying that 'There are things in the world that we cannot quantise. Like Love, Eternity, Satisfaction, Sanctification, and Divine Glory.' But there are subjects where we can make lives good for everyone. We cannot control what happens to us due to the outside world. But it is in our own wish how we respond to it. The best and satisfying reply to an answer is 'I don't know'. Man may not understand how things happen to him, but one day the truth shall reveal itself and that would be too late to realise that Man has wasted all his life contemplating over things that aren't meant to be understood by him. We can't even explain on what basis we are gifted life. But we rather jump high to figure out how things around us were created. It's foolish trying to contextualize the reason behind everything's existence when we can't even create a thing. All that mankind has done is making things. Not creating them. Not even an ion / atom has been newly created or has been removed since the origin of the Universe.</p>
            
                                                        <p>The problem begins when Man thinks he is big to understand things. Man is a humble being. Life's sorted when we understand that there's someone bigger than human perception. Many scientists have come to that conclusion in their death bed when they have realised they have never been able to understand the basis of existence.</p>
            
                                                            <p>The greatest lessons aren't taught but rather learnt. It's good to learn the life values of humbleness and submission before it's too late!</p>
